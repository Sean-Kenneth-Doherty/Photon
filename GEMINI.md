# Photon Development Log

This file tracks the development progress of the Photon application.

## 2025-06-28

*   **Repository Initialization:** Initialized a Git repository for version control.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Created a `README.md` with an overview of the project, features, and setup instructions.
    *   Created a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guidelines for contributors.
    *   Created a `LICENSE` file (MIT License).
    *   Moved the original project plan to `PLAN.md`.
    *   Established this `GEMINI.md` file as the development log.
*   **Testing Framework:**
    *   Added `pytest`, `ruff`, and `black` to `requirements.txt`.
    *   Configured `pytest.ini` to resolve module import issues.
    *   Fixed `sqlite3.OperationalError: ambiguous column name: id_local` in `catalog_reader.py`.
    *   Corrected folder hierarchy loading logic in `catalog_reader.py`.
    *   All existing tests are now passing.
*   **UI Implementation (Phase 4 - Initial Setup):**
    *   Implemented threaded catalog loading using `QThread` and `pyqtSignal` to prevent UI blocking.
    *   Removed hardcoded catalog path from `photon_app.py`.
    *   Connected `FolderTreeView`, `ThumbnailGridView`, and `PhotoPreviewView` to receive `LightroomCatalog` data.
    *   Refined the dark theme QSS for a more polished look.
    *   Set up a central welcome message widget.
*   **UI Implementation (Phase 4 - Views and Interaction):**
    *   Implemented `FolderTreeView` to display folder hierarchy.
    *   Implemented `ThumbnailGridView` using `QListView` and a custom model for efficient thumbnail display.
    *   Implemented `PhotoPreviewView` to display selected photo and its metadata.
    *   Implemented interaction between views: folder selection updates thumbnail grid, thumbnail selection updates photo preview.
    *   Added basic keyboard navigation (left/right arrows) for photos.
    *   Implemented basic culling actions (pick/reject, 0-5 star rating) with keyboard shortcuts.
*   **Data Persistence:**
    *   Implemented `CullingDatabase` to store culling actions (ratings, pick/reject) in a separate SQLite database.
    *   Integrated `CullingDatabase` into `photon_app.py` to save and load culling data, ensuring non-destructive editing.
*   **Image Processing Optimization:**
    *   Implemented asynchronous thumbnail generation using `ThreadPoolExecutor` to prevent UI blocking during thumbnail creation.
    *   Added a placeholder image for failed thumbnail generation.
*   **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Corrected asynchronous catalog loading in `CatalogLoader` by properly using `asyncio.run`.
*   **Error Handling & User Feedback:**
    *   Implemented loading messages and error displays in the central widget during catalog loading.

## Next Steps:

*   **UI Polish and Responsiveness:** Continue refining the UI, ensuring responsiveness across different window sizes.
*   **Advanced Culling Features:** Implement more advanced culling features (e.g., color labels, flags, custom sorting).
