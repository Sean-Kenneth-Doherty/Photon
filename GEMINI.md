This file tracks the development progress of the Photon application.

## 2025-06-28

*   **Repository Initialization:** Initialized a Git repository for version control.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Created a `README.md` with an overview of the project, features, and setup instructions.
    *   Created a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guidelines for contributors.
    *   Created a `LICENSE` file (MIT License).
    *   Moved the original project plan to `PLAN.md`.
    *   Established this `GEMINI.md` file as the development log.
*   **Testing Framework:**
    *   Added `pytest`, `ruff`, and `black` to `requirements.txt`.
    *   Configured `pytest.ini` to resolve module import issues.
    *   Fixed `sqlite3.OperationalError: ambiguous column name: id_local` in `catalog_reader.py`.
    *   Corrected folder hierarchy loading logic in `catalog_reader.py`.
    *   All existing tests are now passing.
*   **UI Implementation (Phase 4 - Initial Setup):**
    *   Implemented threaded catalog loading using `QThread` and `pyqtSignal` to prevent UI blocking.
    *   Removed hardcoded catalog path from `photon_app.py`.
    *   Connected `FolderTreeView`, `ThumbnailGridView`, and `PhotoPreviewView` to receive `LightroomCatalog` data.
    *   Refined the dark theme QSS for a more polished look.
    *   Set up a central welcome message widget.

## Next Steps:

*   **Implement Folder Tree View:** Populate `FolderTreeView` with actual folder hierarchy from `LightroomCatalog`.
*   **Implement Thumbnail Grid View:** Display photo thumbnails in `ThumbnailGridView` with virtual scrolling.
*   **Implement Photo Preview View:** Display selected photo and its metadata in `PhotoPreviewView`.
*   **Interaction:** Implement basic keyboard navigation and culling actions.
